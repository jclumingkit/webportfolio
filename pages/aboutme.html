Some may say being a generalist may hinder future career progressions. I disagree in the sense that working in different fields allowed me to gather a variety of skills that will prove to be helpful in my future career as a web developer.</p>

                                <p class="text-justify">Before transitioning to freelance work, I started working in a BPO company as a call center agent. When an opportunity came to work as a freelance admin assistant, I grabbed it once I was sure it would be a long term work.</p>
                                <p>Then six months later, I learned how to sell my skills through copywriting. A couple of months after, I was hired as a social media manager. The job was to create engaging content in Instagram.</p>
                                <p>In December 2021, a client reached out in LinkedIn saying she wanted to work with me. It turns out she saw my work from a previous client. She liked how it was so organized.</p>
                                <p>At the time of this writing, I have three clients, and I work as an admin assistant, social media manager, and graphic designer, respectively.</p>
                                <p>
                                Now, I'm focused on learning web development and eventually land a job as a front-end developer or a product designer.
